# Factor-and-idiosyncratic-VAR-volatility-matrix-models

This project contains the research during research intern in POSTECH Department of Industrial and Management Engineering Financial Big Data Analysis Laboratory (FBDA Lab) from 2025.06.08 to 2025.07.18 advised by professor Minseok Shin. Understanding of following paper and code implementation of method given at the paper is in this repository.

This repository focuses on understanding the above paper by implementing its core ideas in code and reproducing its modeling pipeline. It is designed to serve as a foundation for further extensions, including:

- experimenting with different robust loss functions,

- testing alternative regularization/penalty schemes, and

- integrating variant or generalized factor structures into the FIVAR framework.
